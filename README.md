We also need the package to reflect our new Cloud division that we have added.  Please look at the UML docucument, provided at the link below, to make the necessary additions.  The current MegaCorp package is built in a modular fashion using abstract classes.  Please follow the general template to make the necessary adjustments.

# Acceptance Criteria
